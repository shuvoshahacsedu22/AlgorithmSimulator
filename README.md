# AlgorithmSimulator
In the field of computer science and engineering a student needs to have a very good concept in Data Structures and Algorithms. And to get the clear concept by only theory may not help all the time. So, some sort of visualization and simulation technique can help a lot in this regard. So this web application will come in handy for those students who wants to know data structures and algorithms whole heartedly.Though most part of it has been reorganized from the prototype made by University of San Francisco, some extra features have been added for the convenience of the students.

Algorithm Simulator is a web based application which can be used to simulate algorithms. The web-app is built using Javascript, HTML,
css and python. This app will incrementally update so as to add simulations of new algorithms. This app will come in handy to the students 
who want to understand algorithms clearly.
